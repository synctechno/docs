"While the summer is hot, we push forward to what now is 15.7 -- nicknamed"
" 'Brave Badger' -- right in front of you.  A lot of effort went into this"
" project during the past 6 months, and we dare say it has been worth all "
"of it.  We would like to thank our followers and friends and feedback "
"givers and forum lurkers and contributors and doubters and supporters "
"that helped to make 15.7 what it is.  We wouldn't be here without any of "
"you. Thank you."

"In itself, 15.7 is a simple upgrade from 15.1.12 which we recommend to "
"everyone.  What changes is that development will move to a different "
"branch so that from now on regressions are less likely and therefore "
"stability will increase further.  The provided images may also be the "
"only ones for the next 6 months as we are confident in their longevity "
"and the online upgrade path.  We have also bumped the LibreSSL flavour to"
" a production-ready state and encourage everyone to try it out.  The "
"installer's import configuration tool coupled with a quick and easy "
"installation can help you move from OpenSSL to LibreSSL and back "
"seamlessly."
