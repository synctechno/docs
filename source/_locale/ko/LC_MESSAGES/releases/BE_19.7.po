"19.7, nicknamed \"Jazzy Jaguar\", embodies an iteration of what should be"
" considered enjoyable user experience for firewalls in general: improved "
"statistics and visibility of rules, reliable and consistent live logging "

"party software to up-to-date releases, OPNsense now also offers built-in "
"remote system logging through Syslog-ng, route-based IPsec, updated "
"translations with Spanish as a brand new and already fully translated "
"language and newer Netmap code with VirtIO, VLAN child and vmxnet "
