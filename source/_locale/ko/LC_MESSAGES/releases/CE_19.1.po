"For more than four years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through "

"The 19.1 release, nicknamed \"Inspiring Iguana\", consists of a total of "
"620 individual changes since 18.7 came out 6 months ago, spread out over "
"12 intermediate releases including the recent release candidates.  That "
"is the average of 2 stable releases per month, security updates and "
"important bug fixes included!  If we had to pick a few highlights it "
"would be: The firewall alias API is finally in place.  The migration to "
"HardenedBSD 11.2 has been completed.  2FA now works with a remote LDAP / "
"local TOTP combination.  And the OpenVPN client export was rewritten for "
"full API support as well."

"Security-wise we have not had a lot of necessary third-party software "
"updates.  Feature-wise we are sitting on a number of improvements for the"
" upcoming 19.7 series that will trickle into 19.1.x now, but that have "
"also required larger preparations and testing in the meantime.  On the "
"community side of the spectrum, sponsored by our partner m.a.x. it, we "
"have started to work on better default gateway switching which led to an "
"overall gateway integration rework and then quickly to interface handling"
" restructuring, which in turn led to improving plugin capabilities of "
"core services (OpenVPN, IPsec, Unbound, Dnsmasq, DHCPD, Dpinger).  "
"Looking at it now it has been the largest rework so far on code "
"established many years ago and only occasionally patched.  We hope this "
"shows our dedication to the code base even when things are not always "
"100% bug free.  If you feel like pitching in now is a good time to try "
"the development version and let us know about how it performs."
