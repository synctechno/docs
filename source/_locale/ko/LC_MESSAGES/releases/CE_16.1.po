"No, we would not say it was easy getting here, but booting into 16.1 for "
"the first time sure is as relieving (and exciting) as it could get for "
"our project growing beyond what we had ever imagined.  It has been more "
"than a year since OPNsense first came out.  Back then it was FreeBSD "
"10.0.  Not even two months after, 10.1 was introduced along with the "
"opnsense-update utility.  Today is the day for FreeBSD 10.2, the latest "
"and greatest release currently available for broader driver support and "
"stability improvements."

"16.1 is nicknamed \"Crafty Coyote\" in honour of our beloved childhood TV"
" sessions.  It is the accumulation of 6 months of work, having had our "
"focus on reengineering the captive portal, native intrusion prevention, "
"plugin support, and transforming the reporting frontend into something "
"more modern and flexible just to name a few `[1] "
"<https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__ .  Apart from the recently "
"published security advisories (see patch notes below), we have included a"
" quick navigation feature which can be activated by pressing (TAB) "
"followed by search keywords and hitting (ENTER) to go to the desired "
"page.  Last but not least, a larger batch of improvements and fixes went "
"into assorted sections of the GUI that certainly help to get your work "
"done without ending up dazed and confused."
