"We would like to encourage everyone to supervise this major upgrade "
"physically.  As such, it cannot be performed from the GUI.  Instead, go "
"to the root console menu, choose option 12 and type \"17.1\" at the "
"prompt. The process will download a full set of updates and reboot "
"multiple times. All operating system files and packages will be "
"reinstalled as a consequence. This process can also be remotely triggered"
" via SSH."
