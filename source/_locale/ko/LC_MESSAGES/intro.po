"While reading the documentation, it's good to know how the various topics"

"If you're looking for deeper insights about networking and best practices"
" in designing them, this might not be the best place to look. Most of our"
" documents and how-to's focus on how to use functionality included in our"
" software and/or one of it's plugins. Quite some books are written about "
"networking, there are (online) courses available and wikipedia contains a"
" lot of relevant articles as well. Some interesting reads include the "
"fundamentals about the `OSI model "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model>`__, `IP addressing "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address>`__, `routing "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_routing>`__ and `network address "
"translation "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation>`__. Likely "
"these resources are more suitable for learning about general network "
"concepts. Although we do try to include some context in our documents, "
"there are often assumptions made about the readers knowledge on (basic) "
"networking."

"Like many products and projects, ours grows over time, functionality "
"extends and changes, which sometimes makes it difficult to find what you "

"documentation up to date, sometimes text doesn't reflect reality anymore."
" If that's the case and you think you found an omission, don't hestitate "
"to open a report using one of our templates on `GitHub "

"Both community and third-party plugins have their own area available, "
"although they eventually register into the same menu structure, it's good"
" to know about possible differences between add-ons and standard "
"functionality. The level of support may differ between core "
"functionality, as also explained in the \"Support options\" section, "
"feature requests and bugs maybe treated different as well (a lot of "
"questions for a plugin which is being developed by a single person, maybe"
" less active than a group of people improving a plugin together for "
