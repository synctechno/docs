"The relayd plugin offers a load balancer which is capable of handling OSI"
" layer 3 or 7 forwarding services to various backend servers while "
"validating their availability."

#: ../../source/manual/relayd.rst:8

"One of the main advantages over other forwarding services available for "
"OPNsense is that relayd offers a transparant forwarding mode in layer 3 "
"(redirection), which is lightweight and forwards the unmodified session "

"A table check defines how relayd should determine for a group of hosts if"
