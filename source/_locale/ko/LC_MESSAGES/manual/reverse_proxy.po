"A reverse proxy is software which takes a request or a connection from a "

"A webserver, in contrast to a reverse proxy, finally processes the "

"modified or cached by a reverse (for example Varnish_, nginx_) or forward"
" proxy (see :doc:`how-tos/proxyicapantivirus`, :doc:`how-"

msgid ""
"The advantage of this setup is that you can use it to route based on "
"paths or other properties and you can present another certificate to the "
"client. For example, you can use an internal certificate on the server "
"and the reverse proxy will present a probably trusted certificate like "
"one of Let's Encrypt to the client. This simplifies certificate handling "
"because the upstream client may be invalid (for example outdated). Please"
" note that it is not recommended to disable certificate checks in the "
"upstream but it may be required in some setups."

"2) Decrypt an encrypted upstream (downstream plain, upstream TLS "
"protected)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual/reverse_proxy.rst:161
msgid ""
"This setup may not make much sense in most cases. It may have the "
"advantage if you have trouble with some software which does not allow a "
"not encrypted port but a special internal client does not support it. For"
" example a machine needs to talk to a server but cannot use TLS because "
"the hardware does not support it. If you need that, do not make it "
"available via the internet because there is probably a reason that the "
"upstream server is TLS only."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual/reverse_proxy.rst:187
msgid ""
"In this mode, the proxy will just pass though the connection and has no "
"access to the encrypted payload. You cannot match on anything of the "
"protocol itself. You may use some extension headers like SNI to decide, "
"which upstream is used. This setup is recommended if you only want some "
"improved routing decisions better than plain NAT."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual/reverse_proxy.rst:194
msgid ""
"A reverse proxy can still get access to the encrypted content if it has "
"the private Key of the server and a cipher without PFS_ is used. In other"
" cases the connection can only be decrypted if one of the peers escrows "
"the key. Firefox supports this via the environment SSLKEYLOGFILE_. This "
