"In the top left corner of the page you can build filter conditions for "

"The live log only shows rules that are matched by the firewall, in case a"
" state is created the flow will be reported for the first packet, as long"
" as the state still exists no new lines will be reported for the same "
"traffic flow. If you need to inspect raw traffic, it's often practical to"
" combine the live-log with the packet capture feature found under "
"interface diagnostics in the menu."

"Since log lines are stored on the system without an exact match to the "
"rule in question, we do need to translate the sequence in the file back "
"to the rule definition stored in the system. Due to this fact, the "
"information is less accurate historically if the firewall was "
"reconfigured. (labels may be incorrect when looking at older data)"
