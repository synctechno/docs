"Plugins are additional software packages that are available for OPNsense,"
" usually they come with their own frontend components to setup the "
"software underneath. Here you can find community support plugins, such as"
"  **bind**, **c-icap**, **freeradius** and others. Usually there is also "
"a **-devel** version available, which contains features still under "
"development (master branch on GitHub versus release)."

"OPNsense supports two flavours for its TLS crypto stack, OpenSSL and "
"LibreSSL. Our standard is `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`__, but "

"<https://www.libressl.org/>`__"

"The settings menu also provides the option to test development versions, "
"which can be practical when testing features that are planned for "
"release. Just change the release type to **Development**."
