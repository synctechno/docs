"OPNsense速 comes with a lot of features included in the base system, for "
"some situations you may need additional software, which is either "
"provided via a plugin or only as a binary package (without user "
"interface)."

"Plugins are packages offered by OPNsense速, which can be installed "

"The plugin repository is maintained by the project, when plugins are not "
"kept up to date by its maintainer, they will be removed at some point in "

"OPNsense速 is a firewall distribution, we aim to keep our footprint as "

" you could always ask via a support ticket on `GitHub "
