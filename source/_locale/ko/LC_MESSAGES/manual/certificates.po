"In OPNsense, certificates are used for ensuring trust between peers. To "
"make using them easier, OPNsense allows creating certificates from the "
"front-end. In addition to that, it also allows creating certificates for "
"other purposes, avoiding the need to use the ``openssl`` command line "
"tool. Certificates in OPNsense can be managed from :menuselection:`System"
" --> Trust --> Certificates`."

"Make sure that you select the correct certificate type, as many clients "
"will refuse connection (or at least show errors) if an incorrect "
"certificate type is used. For example, you can use either a server "
"certificate or a combined client/server certificate to secure the "
"connection to the web interface, but not a CA or client certificate."
