"Besides wired, wireless and VPN interfaces, there are also some other, "
"virtual interfaces, as well as some miscellaneous interface-related. "
"These options can be found under :menuselection:`Interfaces --> Other "
"types`. This document briefly explains these options."

"Bridging allows to create a connection between separate networks, allow "
"traffic on network A destined for network B (where both networks are "
"connected to your OPNsense device) to reach it via this bridge. Note that"
" this does not include DHCP servicesâ€”this needs to set using :ref:`DHCP "

"GRE (``gre(4)``, Generic Routing Encapsulation) is used to create a "

"LAGG (``lagg(4)``) allows for link aggregation, bonding and fault "

"Loopbacks are logical virtual interfaces which emulate real interfaces "

"VLANs (Virtual LANs) can be used to segment a single physical network "

"Since the vxlan interface encapsulates the Ethernet frame with an IP, "
"UDP, and vxlan header, the resulting frame may be larger than the MTU of "
"the physical network.  The vxlan specification recommends the physical "
"network MTU be configured to use jumbo frames to accommodate the "
"encapsulated frame size. Alternatively, the MTU size on the vxlan "
"interface might be reduced to allow the encapsulated frame to fit in the "
"current MTU of the physical network."
