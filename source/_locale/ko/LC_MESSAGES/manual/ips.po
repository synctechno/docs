"The Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) system of OPNsense is based on "
"Suricata_ and utilizes Netmap_ to enhance performance and minimize CPU "
"utilization. This deep packet inspection system is very powerful and can "
"be used to detect and mitigate security threats at wire speed."

"It is important to define the terms used in this document. An *Intrustion"
" Detection System* (IDS) watches network traffic for suspicious patterns "
"and can alert operators when a pattern matches a database of known "
"behaviors. An *Intrusion Prevention System* (IPS) goes a step further by "
"inspecting each packet as it traverses a network interface to determine "
"if the packet is suspicious in some way. If it matches a known pattern "
"the system can drop the packet in an attempt to mitigate a threat."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual/ips.rst:29
msgid ""
"You can configure the system on different interfaces. One of the most "
"commonly asked questions is which interface to choose. Considering the "
"continued use IPv4, usually combined with :doc:`/manual/nat`, it is quite"
" important to use the correct interface. If you are capturing traffic on "
"a WAN interface you will see only traffic after address translation. This"
" means all the traffic is originating from your firewall and not from the"
" actual machine behind it that is likely triggering the alert."

"Rules for an IDS/IPS system usually need to have a clear understanding "

"The :code:`$HOME_NET` can be configured, but usually it is a static net "

"network."
