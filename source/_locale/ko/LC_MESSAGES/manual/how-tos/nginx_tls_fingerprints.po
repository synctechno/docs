"This manual page is for advanced users only as the feature is not "
"designed to be used by beginners. Maybe the curves are not provided by "
"the TLS implementation and you get an empty string. If this is the case, "
"it is normal but you should expect trouble if you use them as a later "
"version of the software may implement them and then all your connections "
"will be flagged as intercepted."
