"LAN Bridges should really only be used where the LAN secondary, tertiary "
"and other interfaces are not heavily used, if that is the case then it is"
" recommended that an external switch be used instead. That being said, if"
" the CPU is fast enough then it will easily cope with the extra load "
"placed upon it by the bridge."
