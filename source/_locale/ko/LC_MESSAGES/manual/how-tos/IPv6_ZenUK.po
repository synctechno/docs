msgid ""
"The first method is a simple DHCP method which should suffice most users,"
" the second allows you to set up static IPv6 on both WAN and LAN. In "
"either case the addresses and prefixes are constant and even under DHCP "
"will not change. Currently Zen provide a /64 WAN address and a /48 prefix"
" allocation. These will have been given to you by Zen when you request "
"IPv6."
