"Assume company A has local LAN 10.0.1.0/24 and company B has local LAN "

"Voice and in company B network 10.0.1.0/24 is used for Guest Wi-Fi."

"To make it easier we create a Phase2 with company A using 192.168.1.0/24 "
"as *Local Network* and 192.168.2.0/24 as *Remote Network* and with "
"company B using 192.168.2.0/24 as *Local network* and 192.168.1.0/24 as "
"*Remote Network*. Now we need to add on each side the local LAN in the "
"field \"Manual SPD entries\". So for company A we set 10.0.1.0/24 in the "
"field and for B 10.0.2.0/24. This allows the NAT process to speak with "
"the Security Policy Database."
