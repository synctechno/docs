"Passwords in password files cannot be stored securely. Your passwords are"
" stored in plain text in the configuration and as md5 in the nginx "
"password files. Secure password hashes like bcrypt_, scrypt_ or Argon_ 2 "

"Please also note that basic authentication transfers the credentials in "
"plain text to the server. It is recommended that you only use it via "
"HTTPS because otherwise every attacker with a network sniffer such as "
"Wireshark_ (and mabe some additional man in the middle tools like "
"ettercap_ or fake_router6_) will be able to intercept your connection to "
"the server and read your password."

"Basic authentication encodes the username and the password in Base64 in a"
" HTTP header. Because it is really simple to implement, almost every HTTP"
" client supports it. For this reason, people use it to protect REST "
"interfaces and so on. Also authentication for the OPNsense API supports "
"this kind of authentication."
