"Source IPs of UDP may be spoofed because the protocol is connectionless. "
"If there is an attacker who can manipulte your WAN, the attacker can also"
" use any WAN IP which has been whitelisted. It is safer, not to use this "
"as the only protection for your webservices."

"IP based ACLs can be externally used to allow access (whitelist strategy)"
" to a specific web service only by customers so you can easily get rid of"
" most of the malicious traffic to the application server. This also has "
"some downsides: For example, the site will probably not be visible to "
"search engines and will therefore not be indexed. On the other hand you "
"can also blacklist (blacklist strategy) some bot IPs and some "
"bulletproof_ hosting ranges."

"Next enter a reasonable title, for example here \"Allow Private IPs\" was"

"the trash can icon deletes the row. This means that this service should "
