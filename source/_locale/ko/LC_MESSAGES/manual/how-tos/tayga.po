"IPv6-only networks are less complex to plan, configure, maintain and "
"troubleshoot than dual-stack networks. But many services on the Internet "
"are still IPv4-only. NAT64 preserves access to these services by "
"performing IPv6-to-IPv4 translation. The NAT64 implementation currently "
"available for OPNsense is the Tayga plugin."
