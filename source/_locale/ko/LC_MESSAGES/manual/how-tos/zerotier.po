"Firstly, it is important that you have signed up to Zerotier at the "
"`Zerotier Portal <https://my.zerotier.com>`_. Second, you will need to "
"create at least one network on the portal in order to obtain a Network Id"
" that this plugin uses to **join** this node to the created Zerotier "
"network. This network will become your private network that by default is"
" visible only to your nodes - in other words, other nodes that are on "
"that network can talk to each other, but nothing else can talk to them - "
"they are completely transparent to the internet in general.  In effect "
"you are layering a private network over the public internet and all "
"intra-node communication is encrypted and private between them. This is "
"further hinted at by the fact that the assigned IP addresses are normally"
" RFC1918 addresses, i.e., non-routable across the internet."
