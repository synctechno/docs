"In general, OPNsense should support all cellular modems that are "
"supported by the respective HardenedBSD kernel. However, not all devices "
"behave the same way, you might have to tweak your card with specific AT "
"commands, for example in the init string."

"Depending on the country you want to use the modem in, you might need a "
"different cellular modem. mPCIe cards are rather expensive so make sure "
"you get a device that supports the LTE bands of the country and provider "
"you want to work with. Use websites like `FrequencyCheck "
"<https://www.frequencycheck.com/>`_ to find the frequency band(s) used "
"and get a cellular modem that supports these frequencies."

"You should also buy an appropriate pigtail antenna cable and LTE antenna."
" Note that LTE antennas often have different connectors than Wi-Fi "
"antennas, chose your equipment accordingly. Getting the right antenna has"
" a big impact on the quality of your signal. For LTE, MIMO (multiple "
"input, multiple output) antennas should be considered, see for example "
