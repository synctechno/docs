"WireGuard is a simple and fast modern VPN protocol. It aims to be faster "
"and less complex than IPSec. It intends to be considerably more "
"performant than OpenVPN. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is "
"now cross-platform and widely deployable."

"Go to tab **Local** and create a new instance. Give it a **Name** and set"
" a desired **Listen Port**. If you have more than one service instance be"
" aware that you can use the **Listen Port** only once. For **Tunnel "
"Address** choose a new virtual network to run communication over it, just"
" like with OpenVPN or GRE (e.g. 192.168.0.1/24). **Peers** can not be "
"chosen yet since we have not created them yet. After hitting **Save "
"changes** you can reopen the newly created instance, write down your new "

"**Allowed IPs** e.g. *192.168.0.2/32, 10.10.10.0/24*. This will set the "
"remote tunnel IP address (/32 is important when using multiple endpoints)"
