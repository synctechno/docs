"OPNsense can offer HTTP and HTTPS protection by utilizing its highly "
"flexible proxy and the industry standard ICAP. An external engine from "
"one of the known vendors is used to offer maximum protection against "
"malware, such as ransomware, trojans and viruses. This protection can be "
"further enhanced by the built-in Intrusion Prevention System and Category"
" Based Web filtering."

"The Anti Virus Engine can protect you against malicious websites and "
"infected file downloads, it does not protect the local clients. Therefore"
" it is always a good idea to install a client based solution as well to "
"protect against other forms of infection such as through emails or usb "
"stick."
