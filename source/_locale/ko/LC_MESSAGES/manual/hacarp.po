"OPNsense utilizes the Common Address Redundancy Protocol or CARP for "
"hardware failover. Two or more firewalls can be configured as a failover "
"group. If one interface fails  on the primary or the primary goes offline"
" entirely, the secondary becomes active."

"Utilizing this powerful feature of OPNsense creates a fully redundant "
"firewall with automatic and seamless fail-over. While switching to the "
"backup network connections will stay active with minimal interruption for"
" the users."

"Although its not required to synchronize the configuration from the "
"master machine to the backup, a lot of people would like to keep both "
"systems (partially) the same."

"To prevent issues spreading over both machines at the same time, we "

"In case of an emergency, you should still be able to switch to the backup"

"Although we advise to make sure to keep the backup machine intact during "
"maintenance, some people prefer to keep the backup in sync on periodic "
"intervals. For this reason we added a cron action which you can schedule "

"To use this feature, add a new cron job containing the :code:`HA update "

"Although not really a setting on the high availability setup page, it's a"
