"Netflow is a monitoring feature, invented by Cisco, it is implemented in "
"the HardenedBSD kernel with ng_netflow (Netgraph). Since Netgraph is a "
"kernel implementation it is very fast with little overhead compared to "
"softflowd or pfflowd."

"While many monitoring solutions such as Nagios, Cacti and vnstat only "

"If you are not interested in ingress traffic then OPNsense offers the "
"option to filter this traffic. When utilizing a proxy on the same device "
"its important to capture the ingress flows as well, otherwise all proxy "
"traffic won't be visible. Downside is of course that all traffic not "
"passing the proxy will we counted twice due to the mentioned NAT effect."
