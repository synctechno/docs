"Multi WAN scenarios are commonly used for failover or load balancing, but"
" combinations are also possible with OPNsense."

#: ../../source/manual/multiwan.rst:24
msgid ""
"WAN failover automatically switches between WAN connections in case of "
"connectivity loss (or high latency) of your primary ISP. As long as the "
"connection is not good all traffic will be routed of the next available "
"ISP/WAN connection and when connectivity is fully restored so will the "
"routing switch back to the primary ISP."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual/multiwan.rst:33
msgid ""
"Load balancing can be used to split the load between two (or more) ISPs. "
"This enhances the total available bandwidth and/or lowers the load on "
"each ISP."

#: ../../source/manual/multiwan.rst:36
msgid ""
"The principle is simple: Each WAN connection (gateway) gets a portion of "
"the traffic. The traffic can be divided equally or weighted."

#: ../../source/manual/multiwan.rst:42
msgid ""
"It is also possible to combine Load Balancing with Failover in such "
"scenarios you will have 2 or more WAN connections for Balancing purposes "
"and 1 or more for Failover. OPNsense offers 5 tiers (Failover groups) "
"each tier can hold multiple ISPs/WAN gateways."
