"Welcome to about the fork. This page is intended to explain the original "
"motivation for forking, but keep in mind that currently less than 10% of "
"the original legacy code base remains. As it stands today, OPNsense has "
"evolved from being a fork to a whole new security platform with leading "
"innovations such as weekly security updates for all components, a REST "
"API, inline Intrusion Prevention and an intuitive modern user interface."

msgid "So why did we fork?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/history/thefork.rst:18
msgid ""
"Back in 2014, after having sponsored pfSense® for years, we felt that "
"there was no other option than to fork the project and to keep the spirit"
" of the - original m0n0wall based fork - alive. Below you can read about "
"our original motivations and the birth of OPNsense®."

msgid ""
"We had technical reasons to fork. As much as we love the "
"functionality/feature set of pfSense, we do not enjoy the :doc:`code "
"quality </development/guidelines/basics>` and dispersed development "
"method. We like structure, achievable goals set forth in a `roadmap "
"<https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__ with regular releases and a "
"decent :doc:`framework </development/architecture>`."

msgid "Security"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/history/thefork.rst:35
msgid ""
"On the security part the main issue was the need to separate logic. The "
"GUI should not perform tasks that require root access, and potential "
"security issues should be fixed before they become a real problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "Quality"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/history/thefork.rst:41
msgid ""
"As for quality, all new features will be built using a solid "
":doc:`framework </development/architecture>` with a Model View "
"Controller. For this purpose we choose `Phalcon "
"<https://phalconphp.com/nl/>`__ as it is the fastest open source PHP "
"framework available. And we will gradually migrate parts inherited from "
"pfSense to the new framework to avoid a big-bang approach."

msgid "Community"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/history/thefork.rst:48
msgid ""
"A thriving community can only exist when people are willing to share. We "
"want to make it easier for people to join and help to build the "
"community. With pfSense, this has been rather difficult, as the tools to "
"build it are difficult to use and often do not work in the first few "
"attempts. And since 2014 they are not freely available any more, you need"
" to apply for access with ESF. We believe a good open source project has "
"nothing to hide so access to the sources should be there for all. It will"
" remain a mystery why ESF made that move, as commit rights and read "
"rights are totally different."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/history/thefork.rst:59

"ESF has since changed their policy several times with different license "
"models, including the ESF 6 clause license and the latest being a Apache "
"style license."

msgid "Transparency"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/history/thefork.rst:64
msgid ""
"A real concern with pfSense is transparency. Since Netgate bought the "
"majority share of pfSense and renamed the company to ESF, it has been "
"difficult to understand the direction they want the project to go. "
"Removing the tools from GitHub without prior warning and using the brand "
"name to fence off competitors has scared quite a lot of people. Also the "
"license had changed for no apparent reason…"
