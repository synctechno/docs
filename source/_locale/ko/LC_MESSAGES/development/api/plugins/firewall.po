"We use our standard :code:`ApiMutableModelControllerBase` to allow crud "
"operations on rule entries and offer a set of specific actions to apply "
"the new configuration. Since firewall rules can be quite sensitive with a"
" higher risk of lockout, we also support a rollback mechanism here, which"
" offers the ability to rollback this components changes."

"The diagram above contains the basic steps to change rules, apply and "
"eventually rollback if not being able to access the machine again. When "
"calling :code:`savepoint()` a new config revision will be created and the"
" timestamp will be returned for later use. If the "
":code:`cancelRollback(savepoint)` is not called within 60 seconds, the "
"firewall will rollback to the previous state identified by the savepoint "
"timestamp (if available)."
