"The command line installation method was the primary means for installing"
" Zenarmor before it was officially available on the “Plugins” page in the"
" OPNsense web interface. This option is still available for users who "
"have direct access to the OPNsense system yet prefer using command line "
"tools or who may only have remote shell access via SSH to administrate "
"their OPNsense installations. However, accessing the web interface is "
"still necessary after installation to complete the initial configuration "
"of Zenarmor."
