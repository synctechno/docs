"HardenedBSD is a fork of FreeBSD, founded in 2014, that implements "
"exploit mitigations and security hardening technologies. The primary goal"
" of HardenedBSD is to perform a clean-room re-implementation of the "
"grsecurity patchset for Linux to HardenedBSD."

"Work on HardenedBSD began in 2013 when Oliver Pinter and Shawn Webb "
"started working on an implementation of Address Space Layout "
"Randomization (ASLR), based on PaX's publicly-available documentation, "
"for FreeBSD. At that time, HardenedBSD was meant to be a staging area for"
" experimental development on the ASLR patch. Over time, as the process of"
" upstreaming ASLR to FreeBSD became more difficult, HardenedBSD naturally"
" became a fork."

"HardenedBSD completed its ASLR implementation in 2015 with the strongest "
"form of ASLR in any of the BSDs. Since then, HardenedBSD has moved on to "
"implementing other exploit mitigations and hardening technologies. "
"OPNsense, an open source firewall based on FreeBSD, incorporated "
"HardenedBSD's ASLR implementation in 2016."

"In May 2015, HardenedBSD announced collaboration with OPNSense. A "
"HardenedBSD-flavored version of OPNsense was published early on as a "
"proof-of-concept work. As the proof-of-concept proved stable, robust, and"
" scalable, OPNsense migrated to HardenedBSD with the support of "
"HardenedBSD's core team."
