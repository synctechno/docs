"OPNsense is built on top of HardenedBSD which is a fork of FreeBSD. The "
"aim of the OPNsense team is to stay as close to the original HardenedBSD "
"source as possible. OPNsense can be installed on a standard FreeBSD "
"installation, this way a hosted system can be converted easily to run "
"OPNsense. A bootstrap script is available to make the installation "
"process a joyful experience."
