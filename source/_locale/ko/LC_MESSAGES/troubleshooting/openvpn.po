"While not strictly necessary, it is possible to assign individual "
"interfaces for OpenVPN servers and clients alike. However doing so may "
"yield unexpected behaviour of firewall rules. Most notably, rules created"
" on an assigned interface of an OpenVPN Roadwarrior server are created "
"with the :code:`reply-to` directive by default, which breaks client "
"connectivity."

"In cases as described above, it can be observed that incoming traffic "
"matches and passes the corresponding firewall rule, but reply traffic is "
"never sent back to the connected client. This can be verified via the Web"
" GUI by going to :menuselection:`Firewall -> Log Files -> Live View` and "
"optionally by performing a packet capture on the affected interface."

"There are multiple ways to fix this problem. For most setups, it  will be"
" sufficient to disable the automatically created IPv4 and IPv6 Gateways "
"under :menuselection:`System -> Gateways -> Single`. Doing so will also "
"disable the automatic addition of the :code:`reply-to` directive to rules"
" created on the interface, and client connectivity will be restored."

"Another option is to manually select the option \"Disable Reply-To\" on "
"each firewall rule you generate on the assigned interface. See "
":doc:`/manual/firewall` for further details."

"The third option is to globally disable the generation of :code:`reply-"
"to` completely as described in :doc:`/manual/firewall_settings`. However "
"this method can break Multi-WAN setups."
