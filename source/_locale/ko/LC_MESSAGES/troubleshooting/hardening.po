"OPNsense tends to choose more strict hardening options by default, so "
"when comparing performance between upstream standard FreeBSD it's good to"
" know which settings differ and can have an impact on your measurements. "
"This document aims to describe (some of) the differences, so when you "
"value performance over security it is more obvious which toggles might be"
" worthwhile to change."
